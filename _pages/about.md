I am currently a Master's student majoring in Machenical Engineering at [Carneigie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/) (CMU). I obtained my undergrad degree with double major in Robotics Engineering and Computer Science at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI).
I have worked under [Prof. Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz) at WPI, and currently working as a research assistant in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at CMU, advised by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/).

My research focuses on robotic motion planning and perception, with applications in smart manufacturing. I work on systems that are aware of the target being manufactured and capable of actively adjusting pre-computed plans to optimize outcomes. I also specialize in processing and understanding real-world 3D data, bridging the gap between computational models and physical environments.
