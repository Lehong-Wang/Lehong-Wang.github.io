I am currently a senior double majoring in Robotic Engineering and Computer Engineering at [Worcester Polytechnic Institute](https://www.wpi.edu/) (WPI).
I am a research assistant at [Robotic Materials Group](https://wp.wpi.edu/roboticmaterialsgroup/) at WPI under the supervision of [Prof. Markus Nemitz](https://www.wpi.edu/people/faculty/mnemitz).
I have also worked as a research intern in the [Biorobotics Lab](http://biorobotics.ri.cmu.edu/index.php) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Howie Choset](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/howie-choset/).

My research focuses on the application of additive manufacturing technology to the fabrication of made-to-order robots. 
My recent works have been on employing computer vision and computer graphics technechnics to improve the manufacturing process.
